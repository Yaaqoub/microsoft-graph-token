# microsoft-graph-token
I am doing some microsoft azure integration with my company internal app using Node.js, I searched
all over NPM to find a package just to manipulate microsoft graph tokens but I didn't succeed, so I
decided to built one myself.

You are welcome to contribute to the package (**Let's make NPM greate again**).

## Install
    npm install microsoft-graph-token

Nothing works yet (Don't do it).

## How it works?

### Authorization Code Grant workflow

### Get Authorization URI

### Get Access Token

### Test Token Expiration Time

### Refresh Token

## Testing

### Running the tests
